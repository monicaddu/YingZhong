			<span>I think of the web as being like the universe. They have no borders or boundaries and can hold anything whether it is living, non-living, abundant, or simple. Every matter in the universe has its right to exist.<br><br>There is no more concept of space and time in the universe, which is a good analogy to our experience of surfing the Internet. Between browsing various websites, I often lose my sense of time and space, immersing myself in the virtual world.<br><br>Just as there are countless stars in the universe, there are countless websites in the online world. What we know so far is only a very small part of them, and there are many more waiting to be explored and discovered. Facing the unpredictable web, we are as curious and expectant as facing the vast starry sky.<br><br>I believe that the online world also has black holes like the universe, which swept us into the realm of ignorance and made us lose ourselves or fall into danger. But the twinkling and dazzling stars always have a unique magic that attracts us to get a unique experience or to create our own stars.</span>
