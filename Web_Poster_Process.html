			<p>These three posters appealed to me the most during the inspiration-seeking phase. I think what they have in common is that they use simple color blocks or linear elements in the layout to guide the flow of the audience's eyes. And there is a strong contrast in the font presentation of different levels of information. The poster on the left first attracts the eye through the large white space in the upper part and then the audience's eye moves to the content of the four plays through the gradient color blocks. The names and descriptions of the plays have a clear hierarchy in terms of font size, which helps the audience to pinpoint the play of interest and then go on to the specific descriptions. The middle poster appears in only three colors, but the hierarchy of information is made clear through the hierarchy of fonts. And the colors used to fill the gaps between text boxes subtly echoes the theme of "bridging the gap" in the poster. The one on the right cleverly uses a curve that runs through the whole picture to guide the viewer's line of sight through the information. This makes the original rigid layout more dynamic and lively.</p>

			<!--subtitile: Layout Experiment-->
			<h2> Layout Experiment </h2>
			<img src="Web-Poster-Process/Web-Poster-Process-02.jpg" alt="Brainstorm sketches" width="100%"/>
			<p> Since the theme of the poster is about the lecture series of guest designers at RISD, when trying some different layout designs, I mainly considered how to let the audience can clearly understand which designers are there or find the lectures they are interested in. After playing around different combinations, I finally come up three layouts i feel more interested in further development.</p>

			<!--subtitile: Colour Experiment-->
			<h2> Colour Experiment</h2>
			<img src="Web-Poster-Process/Web-Poster-Process-03.jpg" alt="Refined sketches" width="100%"/>
			<p>My typeface is inspired by the urban map and ariel views of the city. I found the shape of the architecture looks like symbols and the structure is very organized. So I decided to create a set of typeface which shares the same aesthetic of architectural forms.</p>

			<!--subtitile: Font Choice-->
			<h2> Font Choice</h2>
			<img src="Web-Poster-Process/Web-Poster-Process-04.jpg" alt="Refined design in Adobe Illustrator" width="100%"/>
			<p> After refining my sketches, I imported the drawings into illustrater and created a grid so it would help me with designing the html file.</p>

			<!--subtitile: Final design-->
			<h2> Final Design</h2>
			<img src="Web-Poster-Process/Web-Poster-Process-05.jpg" alt="Final design" width="100%"/>
			<p> In my final outcome, I changed some letters which have curved strokes to make the whole typeface look more consistant in style and reinforce the rigid feeling of urban maps.</p>
