			<p>These three posters appealed to me the most during the inspiration-seeking phase. I think what they have in common is that they use simple color blocks or linear elements in the layout to guide the flow of the audience's eyes. And there is a strong contrast in the font presentation of different levels of information. The poster on the left first attracts the eye through the large white space in the upper part and then the audience's eye moves to the content of the four plays through the gradient color blocks. The names and descriptions of the plays have a clear hierarchy in terms of font size, which helps the audience to pinpoint the play of interest and then go on to the specific descriptions. The middle poster appears in only three colors, but the hierarchy of information is made clear through the hierarchy of fonts. And the colors used to fill the gaps between text boxes subtly echoes the theme of "bridging the gap" in the poster. The one on the right cleverly uses a curve that runs through the whole picture to guide the viewer's line of sight through the information. This makes the original rigid layout more dynamic and lively.</p>

			<!--subtitile: Layout Experiment-->
			<h2> Layout Experiment </h2>
			<img src="Web-Poster-Process/Web-Poster-Process-02.jpg" alt="Brainstorm sketches" width="100%"/>
			<p> Since the theme of the poster is about the lecture series of guest designers at RISD, when trying some different layout designs, I mainly considered how to let the audience can clearly understand which designers are there or find the lectures they are interested in. After playing around different combinations, I finally come up three layouts i feel more interested in further development.<br><br>I ended up choosing the first option because it best represents the CSS typeface I designed. The typeface was inspired by urban map, so for the poster design, I used it on the word "lecture" because the full title is long and it would look complicated if I used all the fonts I designed. By combining the seven letters in different sizes and positions, I hope it can show the feeling of a floor plan of an interior space, or a school map. The viewer's line of sight will also be like "walking through" a corridor to get the information of the whole event.</p>

			<!--subtitile: Colour Experiment-->
			<h2> Colour Experiment</h2>
			<img src="Web-Poster-Process/Web-Poster-Process-03.jpg" alt="Refined sketches" width="100%"/>
			<p>At the stage of trying the color palette, I think the designer's name is the highest priority because the designer's fame will be the biggest attraction. Next is that students need to know that the theme of the event is a talk about the guest designers. This is closely followed by the time and location. Lastly is the introduction of the designers. So I tried a few different color palettes to represent the hierarchy. The rightmost example is that I wanted to experiment with colors to group related content.</p>

			<!--subtitile: Font Choice-->
			<h2> Font Choice</h2>
			<img src="Web-Poster-Process/Web-Poster-Process-04.jpg" alt="Refined design in Adobe Illustrator" width="100%"/>
			<p> In terms of font choices, I pick octin-college from Adobe Fnot for the designers' name because it shares similar aesthtic of my CSS typeface. They both abandon the curve element and replace it with angles. And for the paragraph, I use helvetica as it maintains legibility of the information for small font sizes. The font family for the date on the poster is PT Sans Narrow. I choose it for its narrow style because my CSS typeface also has a narrow feeling. Lastly, I use embury-text for poster tittle and organization name and I think it helps create a little contrast from other fonts which are without curve lines because the title is also important. </p>
