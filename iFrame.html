        <h3>5 June – 21 August 2021<br>Lisson Gallery</h3>
        <p>Lisson Gallery is pleased to present Jason Martin’s first solo exhibition in Shanghai, unveiling eight new works created specifically for the show. As the title suggests, the exhibition is a return to the fundamentals of life – Space, Light, Time – and a mark of appreciation for these facets following the turmoil of the past year, as well as to the foundations of painting. This ensemble of works, all sculpted paste on aluminum with pure pigment, were created by the artist in his studio in Portugal.</p>

        <h2>Loie Hollowell: Recalibrate</h2>
        <h3>24 April－11 July 2021<br>Long Museum West Bund</h3>
        <p>The show is comprised of 15 large-scale paintings created between 2018 and 2020. Produced over the last two years, the canvases belong to Loie Hollowell’s series of Plumb Line paintings which address the artist’s embodiment of pregnancy and render the transfiguration of the female body in stages of prenatal and postpartum existence. Originating in autobiography, the works respond to the artist’s pregnancy with her first child, who was born in December 2018, and the experience of the physical and psychological postpartum journey as it morphed into the pregnancy of her second child, who was born in April 2020. Art historian Elizabeth Buhe reflects on this profound body of work, noting “We telescope from micro- to macroscopic, from internal to external experience, and from the self to the new life one’s own body can harbor.”</p>

        <h2>Tintin and Hergé</h2>
        <h3>08 June — 31 October 2021<br>Power Station of Art</h3>
        <p>Jointly organized by Power Station of Art and the Hergé Museum, this exhibition will not only showcase the art of Tintin, but also shed light on his creator Hergé (the pen name of Georges Remi), an illustrator who used every means at his disposal and never failed to take inspiration from other art forms. Ancient and primitive civilizations were fascinating to him. He always held the grand masters in high regard. He even branched out into painting himself during the 1960s. It was at this point that he developed a passion for some of the most avant-garde artists of the era, collecting works by Warhol, Lichtenstein, Fontana, Dubuffet, Raynaud and others. In his strips, as in cinema, painting and photography, he explored new angles, framing techniques and perspectives. A whole range of processes helped him compose his stories, powerful sequences and images that have made an impression on generations of Tintin readers.</p>
